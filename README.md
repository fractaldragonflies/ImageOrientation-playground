# ImageOrientation-playground
Image orientation as extension to CGImage in Swift 4

Borrowing from example by Jeff McFadden https://gist.github.com/schickling/b5d86cb070130f80bb40#gistcomment-2825670  

I had been off and on trying to figure this out, and finally with Jeff's example, I was able to get the rotate and  reflect operations to work.  Well at least for my rectangular test image!
